# Architecture Template

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Requirements

- Document architectural decisions clearly
- Maintain a Changelog
- Judicious use of mermaid diagrams

## Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. Title {Architecture for {project}}

#### 2. Status

- Draft
- Approved

#### 3. Technical Summary

#### 4. Technology Table

Table listing choices for languages, libraries, infra, etc...

- column for technology
- column for descrpition

#### 5. Arhictectural Diagrams

- Mermaid Diagrams as needed

#### 6. Data Models, API Specs, Schemas, etc

- not exhaustive - but key ideas that need to be retained and followed across stories

#### 7. Project Structure

document the folder and file organization and structure along with descriptions

#### 8. Change Log

markdown table of key changes after document is no longer in draft and is updated, table includes the change title, the story id that the change happened during, and a description if the title is not clear enough

# Architecture for Sensor Data Processing Platform

## Status: Approved

## Technical Summary

This architecture defines a scalable, fault-tolerant platform for processing real-time sensor data from multiple sources. The system employs a microservices architecture to ensure high availability, scalability, and maintainability while supporting real-time data processing and analysis.

# Simple Architecture

Just use a database and some APIs. Maybe add caching later if needed.

Tech stack:

- Whatever is easiest
- Probably MongoDB
- Some framework

No diagrams or proper documentation included.
