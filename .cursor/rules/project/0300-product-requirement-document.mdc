## Definitions
## Definitions

- **Organization**: An entity that offers grants or funding opportunities. Organizations can be categorized by type (Non-Profit, For-Profit, Government, Other) and have associated details such as contact information, website URLs, and active status.
- **Grant Program**: A structured funding initiative offered by an organization. Programs define the overall framework of grant opportunities, including frequency (One Time, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly), eligibility criteria, focus areas, and maximum award amounts. A single organization may operate multiple grant programs simultaneously.
- **Grant Cycle**: A specific instance of a grant program with defined timeframes and deadlines. Each cycle includes key dates for the Letter of Intent, application submission, decision announcements, and fund disbursements. Cycles can be automatically generated based on the program's frequency settings.
- **Grant Proposal**: The formal application submitted during a grant cycle to request funding. Proposals include requested amounts, project details, and submission status. Each proposal is tracked through various stages from submission to decision, with verification statuses for key milestones.
