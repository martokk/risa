tagging_notes: |
  Tag what defines the character — and tag what doesn't.

  **Character-Defining Traits:** Tag consistent features that should appear whenever the character is generated (e.g., "red dress", "short black hair", "glasses"). These traits form the visual identity of the character.

  **Non-Essential Recurring Elements:** Tag background or accessory elements that appear frequently but are not part of the character (e.g., "LED strips", "kitchen", "headphones"). This helps the model separate the character from their surroundings.

  **Why It Matters:** Proper tagging teaches the model both what to include and what to ignore unless prompted — allowing clean, flexible generations in different settings.
